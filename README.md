## Introduction
The Student Management System is designed to facilitate the management of student information within an educational institution. It provides an efficient way to handle student records, including personal details, enrollment years, majors, and contact information.

This project aims to enhance the administrative capabilities of educational institutions by providing a structured way to manage and analyze student data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Faker**: For generating fake student data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for running the code.

## Installation
